# Premier League application React version

Some time ago I wrote [this](https://github.com/mb-dir/Premier-League-application) project. As you can see it was written in vanila JS, now I know the basic of React, of course I want to continue learing React, but before it would be good to do some lesss advanced practical project and this is perfect sample for it.
