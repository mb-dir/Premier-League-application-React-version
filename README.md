# Premier League application React version


## Few words of introduction

Some time ago I wrote [this](https://github.com/mb-dir/Premier-League-application) project. As you can see it was written in vanila JS, now I know the basic of React, of course I want to continue learing React, but before it would be good to do some less advanced practical project and this is perfect sample for it. Those two apps differ a bit(mainly in view layout), but the main aspect is the same.

## My comments

This project gave me a comparsion between pure JS and React. I must say that React makes life  so much easier. I had a huge problems with sync the data with DOM in pure JS. When it comes to React project my problem was how to implement the logic as simple as possible instead of "fighting" with sync the data and the view.
